# pdiot2018-data
Shared repository of walking motion capture data for PDIOT 2018

Welcome to PDIoT 2018!

Please collect data using the 3 sets of phones/sensors as described at the first turorial. If you have any problems with eqipment please let me know. The padlock code for the shared locker is 452.

I've added some straps and, clear bags and wipes to the lockers. If you're securing the RESpeck using tape it's best to place it in a bag first, as the glue tends to build up on the case otherwise.

Thanks
Andrew
